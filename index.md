The decision for more advanced education is heavily influenced by the financial burden coming with it and not purely based on talent and enthusiasm for a specific career. Young people would make different choices without the lingering debt burden and would likely not end up in a “job” that they literally hate and only take to make money to survive.

The problem is that students often drop their plans to earn a degree in order to take the attractive positions offered by these desperate employers. Ms. Jackson is worried that when the labor market cools — a near certainty as the Federal Reserve Board raises interest rates, slowing the economy in an attempt to control rapid inflation — an incomplete education will come back to haunt these students.
