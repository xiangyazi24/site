I teach Discrete Math every semester. Each time I really want to go deep into generating function, but I can't. So I would tell my students the only generating function you really need to know is this very boring one for $a_n=1$ for  all $n$ $$\frac{1}{1-x}=1+x + x^2 +x^3+\cdots.$$ Today let's have fun playing with it, by, well, just flipping it.

## Odd Partitions and Even Partitions

After flipping $\frac{1}{1-x}$, you will get, obviously,
$$
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{1-x}} =1-x.
$$
Well that is easy and straightforward. How about the other way to write $\frac{1}{1-x}$? We have

\begin{align}
1-x=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{1-x}}&= \frac{1}{1+x+ x^2+ x^3\cdots}\\
&= \frac{1}{1- (-x -x^2 - x^3 -\cdots)}\\
&= 1+ (-x -x^2 - x^3 -\cdots) + (-x -x^2 - x^3 -\cdots)^2 +(-x -x^2 - x^3 -\cdots)^3\cdots
\end{align}





This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
