**"UIS is not known as a research school; it is a research school if do your research there."**

My Ph.D. [advisor](https://jacklutz.com/) told me the above when I was about to start my career here in UIS. I want to use his words to encourage every student/friend who want to do research in whatever circumstances he/she is in.

For those who want to do research with me, I encourage you to read this page carefully to understand the requirements before we schedule a meeting.

## Time Commitment

Short answer: **Two semesters**. Meet weekly. 10-15 hours per/week.

Time is the most valuable resource required in research. In general, I expect you to work **at least two semesters** with me. Please understand that time commitment applies both for you and for me.

I wish I can tell you that you can just work with me for a few weeks or a summer and then can have a shinny publication on your CV. But that is not the case. Not for the research I do. Not for the backgrounds my students usually have.

## Topics

Please find the (incomplete) list of topics on [this page](topics.html).

Generally, there are two types of topics.

-   Original research. The research I do to publish original/new results. It will usually require more effort from both you and me. And I will make sure I decompose meaningful tasks to get you engaged in the research.

-   Study topics. I have broad interests in theoretical computer science and mathematics. Every now and then there are topics that I want to learn. These type of topics can provide very good training for you as a undergraduate student or master student. These type of topics are called Senior Theses or Capstone Project in other institution, see for example [Jim Fix's (Reed College) topics](https://jimfix.github.io/research.html). Although we don't officially have Capstones in UIS, I want to things along that line.

## Writing/Documenting

Once we start working on a project/topic. I hope you can document your work at different stages (as code, report, slides, poster, video, paper). It will be very useful for your future job/school application, and will be important for me to show off your work, too.

Below are a list of useful tools.

1.  [Notion](https://notion.so) for notes taking.
2.  LaTex for final paper/document.
  -   Use this template ([TEX](LaTex-template/TEMPLATE.tex)) ([PDF](LaTex-template/TEMPLATE.pdf)) for your final report.
  -   Visit [this site](https://math.vanderbilt.edu/bohmanar/latex.html) for more information about LaTex.
  - Use [Overleaf]()
3.  I also use [R-Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to create webpages and notes.
4. Jupyter or Google CoLab to write codes.

## Current Student(s) Advising

- Jared Robbins (2022F to present): Quantum Computing and Mathematical Games.

## Past

1. Rachel Huls (2021Sm, 2021F, and 2022Sp). On large population protocol computable numbers. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06594) published in DNA 28. 
2. Eli Exner (2021F). On normal number and finite automata. 
3. Charlotte Medina (2021Sp). On Champernowne's constant. 
4. Joseph Lolis (2021F). On prime boolean matrices

## FAQs:
  
1. Can I get paid?
  <p style="margin-left: 30px">Every person who does his/her work should can get paid. But currently I don't have funding to support that belief. </p>  

2. Can I get a letter from you?
  <p style="margin-left: 30px">It is my job to write you a letter if you do research with me. It will be hard for me to write a strong one for you if you exit in the middle. I will actually be reluctant in writing you a letter in this circumstance. </p>  
3. How do I exit the project early?
  <p style="margin-left: 30px">Just tell me you want to leave. It will save both your time and mine this way. </p> 

4. How do I continue my research with you after a winter break or summer break? 
  <p style="margin-left: 30px">Just send me a letter to schedule regular meetings for the new semester. **I will not initiate the that conversation.** I tried that before and only to learn that the students had already decided to leave. So I will assume if you don't contact me early in a semester, you're leaving.</p> 
  
5. How many students do you mentor/advise every semester? 
<p style="margin-left: 30px">**Three**. I used to think I can advise every student approaching me. But I've learned my lesson.</p> 

6. Do you want a CV/Cover Letter from me? Do I have to have a high GPA?
<p style="margin-left: 30px"> I need something that I can learn about you, whatever you believe that can help. Here is a [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/jbhuang0604/status/1627191986091438080?s=12&t=N3lPFCtR3BV7qWGTd_cCUw) that makes some useful suggestion in a funny way.</p> 

7. Do you have any projects in Machine Learning? 
<p style="margin-left: 30px">No. I don't have any machine learning project currently.</p> 

8. Do I have to take credits from you?
<p style="margin-left: 30px">I would appreciate it if you register research credits from me. Then I will get pay by a very small amount by UIS    . But you don't have to. </p>
