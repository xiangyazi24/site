%=====================ComS 511 LaTeX template, following the CMU 02-713 template================
%
% You don't need to use LaTeX or this template, but you must turn your homework in as
% a typeset PDF somehow.
%
% How to use:
%    1. Update your information in section "A" below
%    2. Write your answers in section "B" below. Precede answers for all
%       parts of a question with the command "\question{n}{desc}" where n is
%       the question number and "desc" is a short, one-line description of
%       the problem. There is no need to restate the problem.
%    3. If a question has multiple parts, precede the answer to part x with the
%       command "\part{x}".
%    4. If a problem asks you to design an algorithm, use the commands
%       \algorithm, \correctness, \runtime to precede your discussion of the
%       description of the algorithm, its correctness, and its running time, respectively.
%    5. You can include graphics by using the command \includegraphics{FILENAME}

\section{Mathematical Induction}
\question{1}{Cube Sum. (7th Ed P329 Q4, 10 pts) **}
Let $P(n)$ be the statement that $1^3+2^3+\ldots +n^3= \bigg(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\bigg)^2$ for positive integer $n$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] What is the statement $P(1)$?
    \item[(b)] Show that $P(1)$ is true, completing the basis step of the proof.
    \item[(c)] What is the inductive hypothesis?
    \item[(d)] What do you need to prove the inductive step?
    \item[(e)] Complete the inductive step, identifying where you use the inductive hypothesis.
    \item[(f)] Explain why these steps show that this formula is true whenever $n$ is a positive integer.
\end{enumerate}
\
\question{2}{Wrong Proof!  (Text Page 24, 3.12. 10 pts)}
Read carefully the following induction proof:

\textbf{Assertion}: $n(n + 1)$ is an odd number for every $n$.

\begin{proof}
Suppose that this is true for $n-1$ in place of $n$; we prove it for $n$, using the induction hypothesis. We have $n(n + 1) = (n-1)n + 2n$.
Now here $(n-1)n$ is odd by the induction hypothesis, and $2n$ is even. Hence $n(n + 1)$ is the sum of an odd number and an even number, which is odd.
\end{proof}
The assertion that we proved is obviously wrong for n = 10: 10 Â· 11 = 110 is even.

What is wrong with the proof? Give you answer in one short sentense.

\question{3}{Wrong Proof! (Text Page 24, 3.13. 10 pts)}
Read carefully the following induction proof:

\textbf{Assertion}: If we have $n$ lines in the plane, no two of which are parallel, then they all go through one point.
\begin{proof}
The assertion is true for one line (and also for 2, since we have assumed that no two lines are parallel). Suppose that it is true for any set of $n-1$ lines. We are going to prove that it is also true for $n$ lines, using this induction hypothesis.

So consider a set of $S = \{a, b, c, d,\cdots\} $of $n$ lines in the plane, no two of which are parallel. Delete the line c, then we are left with a set $S^{\prime}$ of $n-1$lines, and obviously no two of these are parallel. So we can apply the induction hypothesis and conclude that there is a point $P$ such that all the lines in $S^{\prime}$ go through $P$ . In particular, $a$ and $b$ go through $P$ , and so $P$ must be the point of intersection of $a$ and $b$.

Now put $c$ back and delete $d$, to get a set $S^{\dprime}$ of $n-1$ lines. Just as above, we can use the induction hypothesis to conclude that these lines go through the same point $P^{\prime}$ ; but
just like above, $P^\prime$ must be the point of intersection of $a$ and $b$. Thus $P^\prime = P$. But then we see that $c$ goes through $P$ . The other lines also go through $P$ (by the choice of $P$ ), and so all the $n$ lines go through $P$ .
\end{proof}

But the assertion we proved is clearly wrong; where is the error? Keep you answer short.


\question{4}{Postage Problem (10 pts ***)}
Let $P(n)$ be the statement that a postage of $n$ cents can be
formed using just 4-cent stamps and 7-cent stamps. The parts of this exercise outline a strong induction proof that $P(n)$ is true for $n\geq 18$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]  Show statements $P(18)$, $P(19)$, $P(20)$, and $P(21)$
are true, completing the basis step of the proof.
    \item[(b)] What is the inductive hypothesis of the proof?
    \item[(c)] What do you need to prove in the inductive step?
    \item[(d)] Complete the inductive step for $k\geq 21$.
     \item[(e)] Explain why these steps show that this statement is
true whenever $n\geq 18$.
\end{enumerate}

\question{5}{Line and Faces(10 pts ***)}

 Suppose that we draw $n$ lines in the plane, in general position (no lines are parallel, no point belongs to more than two lines). The lines divide up the plane into a set of regions. Prove the following claim, for any positive integer n:

Claim: we can color these regions with two colors, such that adjacent regions (i.e. touching along an edge) never have the same color.
