# Part I: Priority Queue data structure.

## Priority Queue Recap

In this assignment you will implement a priority queue and use it to solve the _Almost Shortest Path_ problem. You might want to implement it as reusable library component. Recall that a priority queue is a data structure whose primary function is to return from a collection of items the item with the highest priority. How priority is defined can vary, but it is essential that all the items in a priority queue must be capable of being ordered on some characteristic possessed by all the items, such that it can be determined which of the items has the highest priority.

Technically speaking, any data structure can be used as a priority queue, including a simple array. However, we are not only concerned with returning the highest priority item; we also want to be able to do it as efficiently as possible. In fact, we want to guarantee that the item with the highest priority can be returned in O(1) time. We also want efficient restructuring of the priority queue following the removal of the highest priority item. Depending on the application, we may also need to ability to access any item in the priority queue by a key, or ID, for example, if we need to change the priority of an item.

Clearly, simple data structures such as lists will not suffice for our purposes. There is one data structure that will meet all three of our criteria, however: the __binary heap__.

The central characteristic of a binary heap is the fact that it is built on a complete binary tree. A complete binary tree is a binary tree where every level of the tree is full with the possible exception of the level containing the leaf nodes, and the leaf nodes are filled from left to right. Figure 1 illustrates an example of a __complete binary tree__.

![A complete binary tree](complete_binary_tree.png)
A binary heap is a complete binary tree on which an ordering on the items is imposed. There are two possible orderings that can be used:

1. __(Min heap)__ The item in any given node is less than or equal to the item in either child node.
2. __(Max heap)__ The item in any given node is greater than or equal to the item in either child
node.

Either ordering can be used, with the needs of the problem dictating whether a min heap or a max heap
is warranted. Traditionally, even though we tend to talk about a priority queue returning the item with
the highest priority, it is usually implied that the priority values of the items represent the rank order in which the items should be returned. Thus, a min heap is most often used (yes, your will need a min heap for Dijkstra  Algorithm), and the remaining discussion assumes a min heap.

Based on the ordering rule for a min heap, it can be reasoned that the item with the highest priority; i.e., the lowest rank, is present in the root node of the heap. Since the root node of a binary tree can always be accessed in O(1) time, our requirement that the highest priority item of a priority queue be accessed in O(1) time has been met.

Another consequence of the complete binary tree structure is that the nodes can be stored in an array,
such that the root node is stored at index 1. (Index 0 is used as temporary storage, as needed.) This
allows the left and right child nodes of any given parent node, P, to be accessed in O(1) time using the following formulas:

- index(P’s left child) = index(P) * 2
- index(P’s right child) = index(P) * 2 + 1

This fact gives us the O(1) time access of any given item in the priority queue, which is needed to change the priority of an item in O(1) time. The last requirement we need is efficient restructuring of the heap when an item is removed or changed. This requirement is met for us by virtue of the binary tree structure, which allows restructuring following a removal or change operation in O(log N) time.

## Implementing a Binary Heap to Use as a Priority Queue
The basic implementation of the binary heap (specifically, a binary min heap) was discussed in chapter 2 of the text. The authors provided pseudocode for two of the methods, _Heapify_Up_ and
_Heapify_Down_, and gave descriptions on how the other methods should function. I have elaborated a
bit on those descriptions below. The heap you build will need to have the following attributes and
methods:

### <u> Attributes </u>

1. An internal array to store the elements contained in the heap.
2. An integer attribute to store the size of the heap. The size is equal to the number of elements in the heap, not the size of the array.
3. A dictionary or map structure to serve as a lookup table so the index of any given element can be found in O(1) time (on average). In the text this attribute is named, Position. **For each entry in the dictionary, the key would be the item, and the value would be the index where the item is stored.** If you use string or integer data for your input, you can use the item itself as the key. The dictionary will be used to implement the *ChangeKey()* method.


### <u> Supporting Components </u>
1. A _HeapNode_ component or class that represents an individual node of the heap. This component is essential in order to be able to store both an item’s data value and its priority value together in the heap. __Do not__ assume an item’s data value and its priority value are one and the same.

### <u>Methods</u>

<u>Note</u>: _The descriptions and pseudocode below pertain to a min heap. In the text, the authors
have many of the methods parameterized to take a reference to the heap that is being operated
on. If you place these methods within the heap component itself, you will not need to explicitly
pass the heap to any of these methods. Also, note that method 3 through 9 are described in the
text on pages 64-65._

_Additionally, the Insert and ChangeKey methods may be altered slightly to allow both a data
item and an associated priority value to be passed together. Conceptually, a heap only really
needs to store single values that can be compared, so as to impose the proper ordering on the
heap. But to use a heap as a priority queue, where the priority of an item may not always be
apparent given the item itself, it is useful to be able to store both the data item and its
associated ordering value, or priority value, separately, as described above for the HeapNode. I
have reflected those changes below._

1. _Heapify_Up(index)_ – moves an element located at the specified index upwards in the heap to correctly reposition an element whose value is less than the value of its parent. This condition may result from removing an element or from changing an element’s value. This method is described on pages 60-61 of the text, and pseudocode is provided on page 61.

2. _Heapify_Down(index)_ – moves an element located at the specified index downwards in the heap to correctly reposition an element whose value is greater than the value of either of its children. This condition may result from removing an element or from changing an element’s value. This method is described on pages 62-63 of the text, and pseudocode is provided on page 63.
3. _StartHeap(N)_ – initializes an empty heap that is set up to store at most N elements. This operation takes O(N) time, as it involves initializing the array that will hold the heap.
4. _Insert(item, value)_ – inserts the item, _item_, with an ordering value, _value_, into the heap at the end of the array, then uses _Heapify_Up_ to position the item so as to maintain the heap order. If the heap currently has n elements, this takes O(log n) time.
5. _FindMin()_ – identifies the minimum element in the heap, which is located at index 1, but does not remove it. This takes O(1) time.
6. _Delete(index)_ – deletes the element in the specified heap position by moving the item in the last array position to index, then using Heapify_Down to reposition that item. This is implemented in O(log n) time for heaps that have n elements.

7. _ExtractMin()_ – identifies and deletes the element with the minimum key value, located at index 1, from the heap. This is a combination of the preceding two operations, and so it takes O(log n) time.

8. _Delete(item)_ – deletes the element item form the heap. This can be implemented as a call to _Delete(Position[item])_, which operates in $O(log n)$ time for heaps that have $n$ elements provided Position allows the index of v to be returned in $O(1)$ time.

9. _ChangeKey(item, newValue)_, which changes the priority value of element v to _newValue_. To implement this operation in $O(log n)$ time, we first need to be able to identify the position of element $v$ in the array, which we do by using the _position_ dictionary(look-up table). Once we have identified the position of element $v$, we change the key and **then apply _Heapify-up_ or _Heapify-down_ as appropriate.** **You will need to use ChangeKey() method in Part II while implementing Dijkstra Algorithm.**

### Most Common Mistakes and how to avoid them

1. In _Heapify_Up(index)_ and _Heapify_Down(index)_, forget to update position accordingly. You will need to update _position_ lookup-table while you move notes up and down.

2. After _ChangeKey_, forget to heapify, since after modification, the heap property does not hold anymore.

3. Not implementing _position_ lookup table. This is my current strategy to prevent ChatGPT. **You will receive no credit if you just submit a typical mini heap implementation ignoring my requirements.**

## Submission

  - You need to submit your source code through Canvas by the deadline.

       1. A .zip file that contains everything.( Skip this if your project contains only one file.)
       2. Each **individual** source file separately. **Note that I can only make annotation on Canvas if you submit source files this way.

  Points (5%) will be deducted if you fail to follow the submission format.

 ## Grading

   - Please understand the correctness of your code will be tested while your Part II is complete. （You will need to use your Priority Queue in the implementation of Part II.）
   - I make Part I as a separate assignment only because I want you to finish the project on schedule. The submission serves as a **check point**.
   - The total points for Part I is 50. You will receive 20%, or 10 points if you make a **successful** submission by the deadline, by which I mean your project should be in a complete status. Submitting empty file or insufficiently developed initial work does not count.

# Part II: Almost Shortest Path
## Problem Statement:
   Please read [Almost shortest Path](this|.) problem statement on [beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/login).

   Additional instruction on how to find the course page on beecrowd will be posted on a separate thread.

   I personally like this problem very much, since to solve this problem, you do not just implement a classic algorithm, Dijkstra Algorithm, you **adapt** it. You need to adapt it according to the problem, to achieve your goal.

   You might also need to implement **Depth/Breadth Search algorithm (BFS/DFS)** in this task.

## A rough framework to solve Almost Shortest Path problem
 - You will need to first run one round of an adapted Dijkstra Algorithm to find *ALL* the edges that lie on any shortest path.
 - Delete all those edges by **BFS/DFS algorithm**.
 - Run another round of Dijkstra Algorithm.

### How to find all the critical edges
  In the standard Dijkstra Algorithm, every node maintain a link to its **previous** node or **parent** node. Hence by following these links we get store **a single path**. But things need to change slightly here.

  - We need to find **all** paths, not just one.
  - So we need to store all the previous **nodes** that can induce a shortest distance. We will need a **list** of previous nodes, instead of just one previous node.
  - Then when we trace back to generate paths, we need a DFS/BFS algorithm to find all the shortest path, from sink to source (yes, we do in reversibly).

  I will leave it to you figuring out how to maintain the previous nodes. A hint: in the below pseudocode, Line #20, we only update shortest distance when we find an alternative shorter path. What if the alternative path is equal in length with the current shortest distance, i.e., *alt = dist[v]*, what should you do?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Java linenumbers
/*** This is a standard implementation of Dijkstra algorithm, you need to adapt it to make it work for our purpose.
**/

 function Dijkstra(Graph, source):
     dist[source] ← 0                           // Initialization

     create vertex priority queue Q

     for each vertex v in Graph.Vertices:
         if v ≠ source
             dist[v] ← INFINITY                 // Unknown distance from source to v
             prev[v] ← UNDEFINED                // Predecessor of v

         Q.add_with_priority(v, dist[v])


     while Q is not empty:                      // The main loop
         u ← Q.extract_min()                    // Remove and return best vertex
         for each neighbor v of u:              // only v that are still in Q
             alt ← dist[u] + Graph.Edges(u, v)
             if alt < dist[v]
                 dist[v] ← alt
                 prev[v] ← u
                 Q.decrease_priority(v, alt)

     return dist, prev
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note that this above is the classic Dijkstra algorithm. You need to adapt it.**

#### How to maintain previous nodes list?

To maintain the list of previous nodes correctly, we need to make sure that they represent the previous nodes along some shortest path by far. That is, if any shorter distance is found, we need to **clear** the list of previous node totally. The following code piece demonstrates it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java
    prev = new list of lists.  //now is a list of lists.
    for every v in V:
    initialize pre[v] ← empty list.
     while Q is not empty:                      // The main loop
         u ← Q.extract_min()                    // Remove and return best vertex
         for each neighbor v of u:              // only v that are still in Q
             alt ← dist[u] + Graph.Edges(u, v)
             if alt < dist[v]                // find new shorter distance
                 dist[v] ← alt
                 prev[v].clear               // we need to clear the list of previous nodes
                 prev[v].add(u)
                 Q.decrease_priority(v, alt)  // equally good, shortest distance
             if alt = dist[v]
                 dist[v] ← alt
                 prev[v].append(u)          // no need to clear, just append;
                                            // no need to update priority
     return dist, prev

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


### Important Note
  Java (or maybe similarly in other language) does not provide a _ChangeKey_ method for [Priority Queues](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/util/PriorityQueue.html).
  One possible detour is to first _delete_ an item then _insert_ it back with the changed value. However, a normal _delete_ will cost $O(n)$ time, if the current size of the heap is $n$, since heaps are not really well ordered (it doesn't sort its elements). That is why we use mapping/dictionary to speedup the look-up of the position of an item. You can see [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6952660/java-priority-queue-reordering-when-editing-elements) on StackOverflow for more discussions.

## Typical mistakes
    1. Use a loop to do classic Dijkstra algorithm to find shortest paths, update the graph after delete a single shortest path, until the shortest distance to destination changes. Several drawbacks of this approach:
       - Efficiency: need to do multiple rounds Dijkstra algorithms, it can be very bad in an adversary graph.
       - The order of deleting paths matters.
    2. Delete nodes along a path, instead of edges. This is due to misunderstanding what we mean by almost shortest path.
## Testing
  1. You might want to test you Priority Queue before you integrate it in your almost shortest path solution. Before that, it is a not a bad idea to use a Priority Queue library in your language of choice to write your almost shortest path solution, if you want to attempt that first.But you have to switch back to your own version in your final submission.
  2. You can find all the test cases on UDEBUG. I will also provide the test cases I extracted from there.
  3. You might want to do you testing on your IDE. And then paste all things in one file to pass the URI tests. Note that Beecrowd only do standard I/O, so instead of read in from a file, you might want to read inputs from standard input (System.in in Java) and output to standard output (System.out in Java).

 ## Grading

 * You Priority Queue part of the homework will be graded by code review:
  - All 9 methods listed above are implemented to run according to the specified Big-Oh efficiencies.
  - Items can be inserted into the heap, maintaining the correct ordering on the items.
  - The highest priority item (item with min value) is always returned by extractMin().
  - Arbitrary items can be deleted from the heap, maintaining the correct ordering on the items.
  - The value of an arbitrary item can be changed; i.e., its priority can be changed, and still maintain the correct ordering on the items.

 * The correctness of your Priority Queue will be tested through the solution of Almost Shortest Problem.
