    **PA3: Computing Large Power Modulo m**

In Chapter 16 of *A Friendly Introduction to Number Theory*, we learned how to apply the successive squaring method to compute large power modulo m. In this programming assignment, we are going to implement it recursively.

# Basic Ideas (theory)
The following simple properties can guide us on developing the algorithm.

    **Property 1**:
        $$(p\cdot q)\% {m} = [(p\% m)\cdot(q\% m)]\% m.$$
That is, if we need to do the product of $p\cdot q$ modulo $m$, we can instead do the $p$ modulo $m$ and $q$ modulo $m$ separately, and multiply the results together. But then the result might exceed $m$, so we need to modulo $m$ for another time.

Now let's consider computing $a ^ b \% m$, we need the following property.

**Property 2**:

    + if b is even:

    \begin{align*}
        a ^ b\% m &= (a ^ {\frac{b}{2}} * a ^ {\frac{b}{2}})\% m, & \quad\text{by rewriting } a ^ b\\
            &= ((a ^ {\frac{b}{2}} \% m) * (a ^ {\frac{b}{2}} \% m))\% m, & \quad\text{
            by property 1.
        }
    \end{align*}
    This suggests a recursive algorithm.

    By now, we should be able to handle even exponents. What if $b$ is odd? Well, we just need to take one out of the $b$. That is, $b-1$ is an even number. We will then go from there.

    + if b is odd:

        $$a ^ b \% m = (a \cdot(a ^ {b - 1}))\% m = (a\% m)\cdot(a ^ {b - 1})\% m$$

**Special Case**:
    We will eventually reduce $b$ to 0, in which case $a ^ 0\equiv 1 (mod\ m)$.

# Pseudocode

By the above analysis, we can implement the function roughly by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ python
def largePower(a, b, m):
    # Base Cases
    if (b == 0):
        return 1
    # If b is Even
    if (b % 2 == 0):
        y = largePower(a, b / 2, m)
        return (y * y) % m
    # If b is Odd
    else:
        y = a % m
        return(y * largePower(a, b - 1, m)) % m
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You will need to work out the details.
